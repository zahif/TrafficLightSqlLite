    Written by Google, the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/">
    google-api-java-client</a> library is an easy-to-use and efficient Java client library for
    accessing Google APIs using JSON and OAuth 2.0.

    <p>
      This library is built on top of two common libraries, also built by Google, but designed to
      work with any HTTP service on the web: the Google HTTP Client Library for Java and the Google
      OAuth Client Library for Java.
